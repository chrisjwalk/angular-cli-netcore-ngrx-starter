# Nx + Angular + .NET 9.0

This is basic demo of how to use a full stack [Nx monorepo](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-monorepo-tutorial) with [Angular](https://angular.dev) and .NET 9.0 with [Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/angular) and a demo Azure pipeline for Azure DevOps.

## Getting Started?

- **Make sure you have at least Node 20.x or higher (w/ pnpm 10+) installed!**
- **This repository uses ASP.NET 9.0, which has a hard requirement on .NET SDK 9.0.x. Please install these items from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)**

## Visual Studio 2022

Make sure you have .NET 9.0 installed and/or the latest VS2022.

    pnpm install

## Serve Development App

```

Both the api (dotnet) and web app (Angular) will build and run in dev mode. Open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ to see the Angular app, or https://localhost:60254/swagger to see the api documentation generated by Swagger.

## Serve Production App (PWA enabled)

```
pnpm serve:prod
```

## Lint

```
pnpm lint
```

## Unit Tests

Run unit tests by executing:

```
pnpm e2e
```

## Build Production App
